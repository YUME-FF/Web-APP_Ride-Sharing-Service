Danger Log

We spend days to finish "Project Design V1" and "Web Deployment V1" 
using UML tools in README.md to specify the overview of our project, 
including what a driver, owner or sharer should do, using arrow to 
represent  it.

In Project Overview, Project Design describes interrelated things of 
interest in a specific domain of knowledge, which is composed of 
entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies 
relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those 
entity types).

In our Project Design, Relationships between entities are represented 
by lines with end markers representing cardinality.We also design 
the foreign keys as attributes, to represent relational table structures.

In Web Deployment, we abstract our relationship between html to 
describe the behavior of systems.


We wonder:
1) The home.html should be divide to UserHome+DriverHome or
OwnerHome+SharerHome+DriverHome.

We finsh our CreatAccount and Login/Logout function.

1) It is dangerous to show plain password.
Thus we change to use Django templete in erss-hwk1-zf70-jz423/web-app
/base, it only used to handle user basement implementations.

2) When designning the form for the user the log in or register, 
firstly we simply used HTML and specified it using tag: label, input. 
At that time we did not realize that there is alreay a form for user 
to create and login in django framework.

3) When CreatAccout, how directly come up a chance to register to be
a driver, it may be convenient for user.

We create UserHome.html, and in that html, user and request a ride,
and see all order he has in OrderHistory(Owner_list.html)
User can Edit and Delete the order.

To ensure they can only edit and delete order in "open" Status, we
add "Status" in the model of Owner to help do it.

We create DriverRegister, and:

1) If user is a driver, he can do what driver can do.
2) If user is not a driver, he only can see "To be a driver?" and
other userChoices.

We add a identity to recoginze whether the user is a driver.

We reDesign our web to be only UserHome.html but not either UserHome+
DriverHome or OwnerHome+SharerHome+DriverHome. By using "identity",
we show different choices between users and drivers.

After designning the driver register. When a user becomes a driver, 
he/she cannot see driver operation buttons.
I looked for the bugs for some time, finding out that I did not feed 
the if-else block in the UserHome to check if the current user is the 
driver. So in views.py, I returned a dictionary that tell the UserHome 
the current user is the driver, and used that outcome in the if-else 
block.

1) We add LoginRequiredMixin to each class to make sure that user can
only implement after login.

2) Replaced sqlit3 with postgresql, we forget set it in settings.py 
previous days. But some problems occurs, so I uninstall the postgresql
and reinstall again and again. Finally it did work.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Using bootstrap to render our website, finding it really useful 
and saving a lot of time. 
2) When writing CSS, images upload failed. Thus we only use basic
designing elements to design our web.

When sharer Edit their order, there could be:
1) They may change the arrival time that not in the range of Owner
previously set.
2) When Sharer change their passage number, the order did not update.

Thus, we decide:
If sharer want to edit their order, they should first delete the order,
and then search & rejoin.
